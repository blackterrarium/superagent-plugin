# Supermeta

The **meta-planner** of the coding loop. Given a READY project folder (`prd.md`,
`knowledge-base.md`, `evaluation.md`, written by `superprd`), supermeta writes the round's
**meta-plan** — a self-contained goal description a planner can turn into a root master plan without
any other context — and drives `superagent:supergoal` (auto-confirmed) to scaffold the goal folder
the inner `superagent` loop will build. It then records the round in the project's iteration ledger.

supermeta **never plans the work itself and never touches source code** (superauthor A1): it produces
structural docs (a meta-plan and a ledger row) and dispatches exactly **one** PLANNER-role subagent
that invokes `superagent:supergoal`.

**Input:** `<project-dir>` — an existing coding-loop project folder. **Required.** Optional:
`--operation <path>` uses a supervisor-persisted operation identity. With no operation, all manual
defaults remain unchanged.

## Repo configuration (.superenv)

Repo-specific values in this skill are named `SUPER_*` keys. Resolve each at point of
use, highest wins: (1) a process environment variable of the same name, (2) the
repo-root `.superenv` file, (3) the plugin default
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/superenv.default`. Read a key with:
`grep -hs '^KEY=' "$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")/.superenv" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/superenv.default" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | sed 's/[[:space:]]*#.*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//'`
(checking the env var first, and anchoring at the primary checkout so worktrees resolve the same config). A repo with no `.superenv` runs on the shipped defaults.

Keys used here: `SUPER_GOAL_ROOT`, `SUPER_PROJECT_DIRNAME`, `SUPER_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`SUPER_EFFORT_PLANNER`, `SUPER_GOAL_AUTOCONFIRM`, `SUPER_EVAL_TIMEOUT_MIN` (read by `prd-lint.sh`).

## Vault root

Resolve `SUPER_GOAL_ROOT` (above). If it starts with `/` or `~`, the vault is **external**:
`<vault_root>` is that path (`~` expanded to `$HOME`, one trailing `/` stripped), resolved physically
(`cd "<path>" && pwd -P`) so it matches the paths `launch.sh` stores, and the vault is its own git
repository outside the checkout. Otherwise `<vault_root>` is `<primary_root>/<SUPER_GOAL_ROOT>`
(`primary_root` = `dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)"`). Every goal
folder, project folder, loop-status file and lock derives from `<vault_root>`; **never join
`SUPER_GOAL_ROOT` onto the checkout root by hand.** The same rule is `vault_root` /
`vault_is_external` in `scripts/_common.sh`.

## What supermeta is not

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The meta-plan is basically the root plan, I'll write the master plan here" | NO. supermeta writes a *goal description* (the meta-plan). `supergoal` scaffolds the goal folder; `superplan` writes the plans; `superrun` executes. supermeta plans nothing (A1). |
| "I'll invoke `supergoal` directly, it's simpler than dispatching a subagent" | NO. supermeta dispatches exactly one PLANNER-role subagent that runs `supergoal`, so the PLANNER model pin applies and the invoking context stays lean. |
| "`--autoconfirm` alone skips the pause" | NO. It is honoured only when `SUPER_GOAL_AUTOCONFIRM` resolves to `true` (two-factor). If the key is not true, supergoal reports `--autoconfirm ignored: SUPER_GOAL_AUTOCONFIRM is not true` and pauses — treat that as a refusal (see step 6). |
| "A defect in `evaluation.md` / `prd.md` — I'll just fix it" | NO. Report it as a finding; supermeta reads the inputs, it does not edit them. |

## Workflow

### 1. Invoke `superagent:superauthor`

Invoke it via the Skill tool and apply **A1** (no execution), **A3** (no placeholders), **A5** (no
confirmation pause — supermeta runs unattended by design), **A6** (findings capture), **A7** (commit
and merge), **A8** (Final Report). **A2 does not apply** — the meta-plan is a structural goal
description, not an implementation plan.

### 2. Inputs

Resolve `<primary_root>` (the code checkout: `dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)"`) and `<vault_root>` (see **Vault root**).

1. `<project-dir>` must exist and contain `prd.md`, `knowledge-base.md`, `evaluation.md`, each with
   `**Status:** READY` in its header block. Otherwise print
   `supermeta: <project-dir> is not a READY project folder (<what is missing>)` and **exit** without
   writing.
2. Run `PRD_LINT_REPO_ROOT="<primary_root>" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/prd-lint.sh" "<project-dir>"`.
   A non-zero exit is the same refusal, quoting the FAIL lines, then **exit** without writing.

When `--operation <path>` is present, load duplicate-key-rejecting JSON containing exactly `id`,
`phase`, `round`, `agreement_revision`, `code_commit`, `meta_plan`, `goal_folder`, `report`, and
`source_vault_commit`. Apply the types and locator rules from `_coding_loop_state.py` and
`_coding_loop_evidence.py`. Require `phase` = `META-PLANNING`, empty `code_commit` and `report`, a
32-character lowercase hexadecimal `id`, and nonempty remaining identity fields. The recorded
`meta_plan` must resolve inside `<project-dir>/meta-plans`; `goal_folder` must resolve inside
`<vault_root>`. Keep the file unchanged for the child.

Operation mode has a machine-readable completion contract. Its last output line is one compact JSON
object with keys `outcome`, `phase`, `operation_id`, `round`, `meta_plan`, `goal_folder`,
`root_plan`, `goal_complete`, `goal_recoverable`, `goal_completion_reason`, `worker_complete`, `completion_reason`,
`artifacts`, and `reason`. `outcome` uses the reconciler's
`INTEGRATED`, `ABSENT`, or `CONFLICT` artifact classification; an integrated reusable goal can still
have `worker_complete: false`. That flag becomes true only after the goal, meta-plan and ledger are
verified on `main`. Paths are absolute and each verified artifact has `path` and `commit`. The caller
uses this result for recovery; the human Final Report is not phase-completion evidence.

### 3. Derive identifiers

- `<STAMP>` — `date -u +%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M`, taken once per run.
- `<project-slug>` — the project folder's basename with its leading `YYYY-MM-DD-hh_mm-` stamp
  stripped (e.g. `csv-summariser`).
- `N` (round) — `1 +` the number of data rows in `prd.md`'s `## Iteration ledger` table (so the
  first round is `1`).
- **Repair guidance** — if `<project-dir>/diagnoses/<…>-r<N-1>.md` exists (never in Stage 2; the
  file layout is fixed so Stage 3 needs no change here), read it and quote its per-problem guidance;
  otherwise repair guidance is `none — first round`.

In operation mode, do not derive identities from the clock or ledger. Use the recorded `round`, exact
`meta_plan`, and only permitted `goal_folder`; derive `<STAMP>` from the frozen basenames and reject
inconsistent round, stamp, slug, ledger, or project identities. Require `source_vault_commit` on
vault `main` and the current agreement fingerprint equal to `agreement_revision` before dispatch.
For round 1, repair guidance is `none — first round`. For a later round, locate the unique FINAL
diagnosis linked to the previous ledger row's failed report and validate it with
the existing Python API and its complete authoritative inputs:

```python
validate_diagnosis(
    diagnosis_path,
    {
        "round": N - 1,
        "eval_report": previous_eval_report,
        "code_commit": previous_evaluated_commit,
        "agreement_revision": agreement_revision,
        "source_vault_commit": diagnosis_source_vault_commit,
        "failing_ids": validated_previous_eval["failing_ids"],
        "missing_ids": validated_previous_eval["missing_ids"],
    },
)
```

First run `validate_evaluation` on the previous report to obtain those failed/missing IDs and exact
evaluated commit; take the report path from the previous ledger row and require the diagnosis's
recorded source-vault revision on `main`. `validate_diagnosis` itself requires a unique operation ID
in the report. The result must match the previous round/report, evaluated commit, agreement and
source revision, return disposition `REPAIR`, and set `may_start_next_round: true`. Missing,
ambiguous, AUTHOR INPUT, or mismatched context is `CONFLICT`; never label a later round as a first
round.

### 4. Read the knowledge base

Read every row of `knowledge-base.md` by its `Kind`/`Locator`:

- `instructions` / `repo-file` / `sample-code` / `entry-point` (`<path>:<symbol>`) → read the file
  under `<primary_root>`.
- `repo-glob` → expand with `find` under `<primary_root>`.
- `doc-url` → fetch **only if** a fetch tool is available; else pass the URL through as a pointer.
- `context7` (`/<org>/<project>`) → resolve with `mcp__context7__query-docs` **when that tool is
  available**; else pass through.

For each row that resolved, keep the 1–10 lines most relevant to planning the work (a function
signature, a config key, a doc sentence) for the meta-plan's Excerpt column.

### 5. Draft `meta-plans/<STAMP>-r<N>.md`, self-review, and move it in

Draft in scratch (`$TMPDIR/supermeta-<project-slug>-r<N>/`) with **exactly** this section order,
then self-review it (A4 — spec coverage against the PRD/evaluation, A3 placeholder scan):

```
# <Project title> — meta-plan round <N> — <STAMP>-r<N>
**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD> · **Status:** READY · **Related:** [[<SUPER_PROJECT_DIRNAME>/<project-folder-basename>/prd]] · **Round:** <N>
**Operation:** <operation id> · **Agreement revision:** <agreement_revision> · **Source vault commit:** <source_vault_commit>   (operation mode only; omit this line manually)

## Goal for this round
<one or two paragraphs: what the inner loop must build or repair this round, written as a goal
description supergoal can plan from without any other context. Round 1: the PRD objective in full.
Round N>1: the objective restated plus the repair scope from the diagnosis.>

## Success criteria and checks
<every SC row from prd.md verbatim, then every C/J row from evaluation.md verbatim, including the
Environment setup/cwd lines, the full Acceptance checklist with its approval record, and all
binding contract notes. Preserve source references and identify the source project revision
(commit plus file paths). Carry optional suggestions separately as nonbinding context.
These are the approved conditions the plan must satisfy; do not derive a new coverage inventory.>

## Knowledge base
| Id | Kind | Locator | Read for | Excerpt |
<every knowledge-base row, plus an Excerpt column: the 1–10 lines the meta-planner judged most
relevant after reading the source. Never empty for rows that resolved; `(not fetched)` for unfetched
doc-url/context7 rows.>

## Constraints and locked decisions
<prd.md's "Constraints and non-goals" and "Locked decisions" sections verbatim>

## Repair guidance
<`none — first round`, or the diagnosis's per-problem guidance quoted>

## Planner instructions
- Goal folder slug: `<project-slug>-r<N>`.
- Every implementation plan's verification steps must run the checks above by id; the loop's
  evaluator will run them unchanged afterwards.
- Carry relevant approved AC IDs, their full requirements and expected results into each leaf
  plan, together with the source revision. Keep a resolvable path to the full agreement. Report
  ambiguity or conflict for PRD revision; do not adopt extra test cases as new acceptance scope.
- Legacy projects without a checklist retain their existing explicit criteria and binding notes;
  do not fabricate an approval or retroactively require the new format. Ambiguous coverage needs
  an author decision, not a fresh unattended checklist.
- Do not modify `evaluation.md`, `prd.md`, or `knowledge-base.md`; a defect in them is reported as
  a finding, not fixed.
```

Then **move** the reviewed file from scratch into `<project-dir>/meta-plans/<STAMP>-r<N>.md`
(uncommitted until the ledger commit in step 7) so the goal folder's `**Source:**` link can point at
its vault path. In operation mode, if the exact path already exists, require its Operation line and
complete identity to match and resume it; never replace it or choose another timestamped name.

### 6. Dispatch supergoal via one PLANNER subagent

Dispatch **one** `PLANNER`-role subagent. Resolve `SUPER_MODEL_PLANNER` / `SUPER_EFFORT_PLANNER`.
<!-- cc-only:start -->
If the model is `inherit` or a bare tier name (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `fable`) **and** the effort is `inherit`, dispatch with the plain subagent mechanism — `model: <tier>` when a tier, no `model:` when `inherit`. Otherwise — a full model ID such as the default `claude-opus-4-8`, a non-`inherit` effort, or a bridged harness prefix — dispatch with `subagent_type: super-planner` and omit `model:`; that is the definition `superagent:init` generates in `.claude/agents/`, and a missing definition is a hard error: report "re-run `superagent:init`" and stop.
<!-- cc-only:end -->
<!-- cursor-only:start
If the model is `inherit` or a bare model name **and** the effort is `inherit`, dispatch with the plain subagent mechanism — `model: <name>` when named, no `model:` when `inherit`. Otherwise dispatch with `subagent_type: super-planner` and omit `model:`; that is the definition `superagent:init` generates in `.cursor/agents/`, and a missing definition is a hard error: report "re-run `superagent:init`" and stop.
cursor-only:end -->
<!-- codex-only:start
For a native Codex role, use `spawn_agent` with `fork_turns: "none"`, `model` (the `codex:` prefix stripped), and `reasoning_effort`, omitting each pin that is `inherit`. For a foreign harness, use the generated banner's relay dispatch with `fork_turns: "none"`; pass the foreign model/effort to `role-bridge.sh`, never to the native spawn. No definition file is involved.
codex-only:end -->
<!-- pi-only:start
The planner gets no `.pi/agents/` definition; dispatch it exactly as `superagent`'s Subagent-dispatch section does the planner on Pi — a blocking `role-bridge.sh --tools planner` process with the model/effort from `SUPER_MODEL_PLANNER` / `SUPER_EFFORT_PLANNER` (a bridged prefix runs that harness's CLI). Wait on it; never poll.
pi-only:end -->
Set `SUPER_GOAL_AUTOCONFIRM=true` **only for this child dispatch**, together with
`--autoconfirm` below. Do not edit `.superenv` or change the caller's environment. For a CLI bridge,
prefix that invocation with `SUPER_GOAL_AUTOCONFIRM=true`; for a native subagent, include
`Treat SUPER_GOAL_AUTOCONFIRM=true as a dispatch-scoped override for this invocation` in its prompt.
On Pi also set `SUPERAGENT_PI_SKILLS="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills"` on the bridge invocation,
so an attended call delivers `supergoal` to the child just as a scheduler tick does.

The subagent's prompt instructs it to invoke the `superagent:supergoal` skill via the Skill tool with

```
<GOAL> = <absolute path of meta-plans/<STAMP>-r<N>.md>   --autoconfirm   --slug <project-slug>-r<N>
```

and to **return supergoal's complete Final Report verbatim** as its final message.

In operation mode append `--operation <the same absolute operation JSON path>`. Before dispatch,
run `_coding_loop_evidence.py reconcile <primary_root> <vault_root> --operation <path>`. An
`INTEGRATED` result supplies the exact `goal_folder` and `root_plan`. If `worker_complete` is true,
return the existing completed operation. If `goal_complete` is true, reuse the scaffold and skip the
PLANNER dispatch while finishing meta/ledger work. If `goal_complete` is false and
`goal_recoverable` is true, dispatch PLANNER once with the same operation so supergoal explicitly
repairs only the missing matching scaffold. A false `goal_recoverable` is a hard conflict. For
`ABSENT`, dispatch once. For `CONFLICT`, resume only exact pending A7 work owned by this operation,
finish its normal integration, and reconcile again. An identity mismatch or
unrelated partial output is a hard conflict. Never infer success from child text, a folder
collision, working-tree bytes, or an unmerged commit.

Parse `**Goal folder:**` and `**Root plan:**` from the returned report. **If** the report is missing
either line, **or** supergoal reports a refusal — the key is not `true`
(`--autoconfirm ignored: SUPER_GOAL_AUTOCONFIRM is not true`), the goal folder already exists (the
never-overwrite collision report), or `I need a goal description` — then supermeta writes **nothing**
to the ledger, **moves the meta-plan back** out of `meta-plans/` into scratch, and reports the
failure **verbatim** with the scratch path, then exits.

### 7. Ledger and commit (A7)

Append this row to `prd.md`'s `## Iteration ledger` table (the goal-folder path is
`**Goal folder:**` from step 6 made relative to `<vault_root>`):

```
| <N> | [[<SUPER_PROJECT_DIRNAME>/<project-folder-basename>/meta-plans/<STAMP>-r<N>]] | [[<goal-folder-path-from-vault-root>]] | - | - | - |
```

In operation mode, inspect `main` for round `N` first. Reuse its one row only when it exactly links
the recorded meta-plan and goal. If absent, append it once. A duplicate or different identity is a
conflict. Commit or resume the exact pending A7 work; do not create another branch, row, meta-plan,
or goal.

Then apply **A7** with:

- **branch prefix:** `project/<project-slug>-r<N>-meta`
- **commit subject:** `docs(project): <project-slug> round <N> meta-plan`
- **PR title:** `docs(project): <project-slug> r<N> meta-plan`
- **PR body:** `Meta-plan for round <N> written by supermeta; goal folder <goal-folder>.`
- **explicit `git add`:** the meta-plan file (`meta-plans/<STAMP>-r<N>.md`) and `prd.md`. Never
  `git add -A`. (supergoal has already committed the goal folder itself under its own A7; the
  explicit list keeps that commit and this one disjoint.)
- **External vault:** A7's target is the vault repo — a direct commit, no PR (see A7 **Target
  repo**); its precondition applies (STOP and report if `<vault_root>` is not its own repository).

After A7, operation mode reconciles again and separately verifies the exact meta-plan and one ledger
row on `main` alongside the reconciled goal plan. Dirty bytes, an unmerged commit, missing or
duplicate output, or an identity mismatch produces a non-integrated JSON result and no phase
completion.

### 8. Final Report (A8)

```
## Supermeta complete

**Project:** <project-dir>   **Round:** <N>
**Meta-plan:** <path>
**Goal folder:** <path>   **Root plan:** <path to master-plans/…>
**PR:** <url> (merged)
**Commit:** <short-sha> in <vault_root>   (external vault — print this line INSTEAD of the PR line)
**Repair guidance:** none — first round | <diagnosis path>
**Next:** superagent:superagent-external <root plan>   (then superagent:supereval <project-dir> when the loop is DONE)
```

After printing the report, take no further action and ask no follow-up question.

In operation mode only, print the compact operation-result JSON as the final line after the report.
