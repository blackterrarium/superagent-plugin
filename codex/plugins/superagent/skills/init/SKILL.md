# superagent:init — repo bootstrap

Prepare the current repository to run the superagent skill family. Every step is
idempotent: report what was **done** vs **already present**; never overwrite existing
files. Finish with a summary table of step → done/skipped.

Invoke this skill explicitly as `superagent:init` — a built-in `init` skill (CLAUDE.md
authoring) ships unscoped in most sessions, so the bare name `init` is ambiguous the
moment both are available.

**Harness check (belt-and-suspenders).** This is the **Codex** build of the superagent plugin
(generated — see the banner above). If you are running under Claude Code — e.g. the
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable is defined in your tool environment — STOP and report:
the wrong harness build is loaded; install the Claude Code plugin from the repository root
instead. Confirm this host can actually drive the loop: the `codex` CLI is on PATH
(`codex --version` succeeds) — else WARN with an install hint (`npm install -g @openai/codex`,
or `brew install codex`). Also make sure only one build of this plugin is loaded at a time —
two builds' inits collide.

## Repo configuration (.superenv)

Repo-specific values in this skill are named `SUPER_*` keys. Resolve each at point of
use, highest wins: (1) a process environment variable of the same name, (2) the
repo-root `.superenv` file, (3) the plugin default
`${SUPER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/superenv.default`. Read a key with:
`grep -hs '^KEY=' "$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")/.superenv" "${SUPER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/superenv.default" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | sed 's/[[:space:]]*#.*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//'`
(checking the env var first, and anchoring at the primary checkout so worktrees resolve the same config). A repo with no `.superenv` runs on the shipped defaults —
which is exactly the case Step 2 below fixes by creating one.

## Step 1 — Prerequisite checks

1. `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir` succeeds — else ABORT: "init
   must run inside a git repository." Derive `<repo-root>` as the `dirname` of that path
   — the same `primary_root()` formula `skills/superloop/SKILL.md`'s L1 clause uses:
   `dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)"`. In the primary
   checkout, `--git-dir` == `--git-common-dir` (both `.git`); in a linked worktree they
   differ (`--git-dir` → `<primary>/.git/worktrees/<name>`, `--git-common-dir` →
   `<primary>/.git`), so `dirname` of the common dir is the primary checkout root —
   regardless of the primary's current branch. **Never** use `git rev-parse
   --show-toplevel` for this: inside a linked worktree (e.g. one `EnterWorktree` created
   for plan execution) it returns the *worktree* root, and init would bootstrap a
   throwaway checkout instead of the primary repo every other superagent skill actually
   reads `.superenv`/`SUPER_GOAL_ROOT` from. `cd` to `<repo-root>` (or prefix every
   relative read in Steps 2-5 with it) before continuing — the `.superenv` resolver above
   greps a bare `.superenv` relative to the current directory, so without this, invoking
   init from a subdirectory (of either the primary checkout or a worktree) would silently
   read the wrong file, or none, and fall through to plugin defaults instead of the
   repo's actual config.
2. The `superpowers` plugin is resolvable (its skills, e.g. `superpowers:writing-plans`,
   appear in the available-skills list). If not: WARN with install instructions
   (`/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace`, `/plugin install superpowers`)
   — planning skills (`supergoal`, `superplan`) work without it, but `superrun` requires
   `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` to execute a plan and will refuse.
3. `gh auth status` succeeds — else WARN (PR-based flows need it; planning artifacts are
   drafted either way, but `superauthor`'s A7 commit-and-merge step and every CI/PR
   operation in `superplan`/`superrun` need it). On a macOS host, a sandboxed `gh auth
   status` can fail even when `gh` is actually authenticated, because `gh` needs keychain
   access the tool sandbox blocks — see `SUPER_GH_DISABLE_SANDBOX` in
   `${SUPER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/superenv.default`. If the check fails on macOS, note
   that possibility rather than reporting a bare WARN.
4. Informational: external (unattended) mode runs on Linux (systemd user timers) and
   macOS (launchd LaunchAgents — logged-in + awake only; crontab fallback documented in
   [scripts/README.md](../../scripts/README.md#cron-fallback-instead-of-systemd)). Run
   `uname -s` and say which scheduler this host would use — planning-only usage
   (`supergoal`/`superplan`) is host-independent.

## Step 2 — Config

If `<repo-root>/.superenv` does not exist, copy
`${SUPER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/superenv.default` to `<repo-root>/.superenv` (keep the
comments — the repo edits knobs in place). If it exists, leave it untouched and report
any `SUPER_*` keys the shipped default defines that the existing file lacks — diff the
key names (`grep -oE '^SUPER_[A-Z_]+='` on each file) rather than the full lines, since
an intentionally edited value is not a gap. This is informational only: a missing key
falls through to the plugin default per the resolution order above.

### .superenv validation (lint — WARN + fallback, never abort)

Validate the RESOLVED configuration (env > repo `.superenv` > plugin default) before
using it. For each finding emit one WARN row in the summary; the effective value used
by later steps is the fallback shown. Never rewrite the user's `.superenv` — this is
report-only.

1. **Unknown keys:** every `SUPER_*`/`TICK_*` key present in the repo `.superenv` must
   also exist in `${SUPER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/superenv.default`. Unknown → WARN
   "probable typo (ignored)". (Exception: a harness-specific key that belongs to another
   build's template — e.g. `SUPER_CODEX_SANDBOX` on a build whose template drops it — is
   a legitimate key in a portable `.superenv`: report it as `ignored (other-harness
   key)`, not as a typo.)
2. **Enums** (out-of-domain → WARN, fall back to the template default):
   `SUPER_HARNESS` ∈ claude|cursor|codex; `SUPER_CODEX_SANDBOX` ∈
   workspace-write|danger-full-access; `SUPER_TEST_EVIDENCE` ∈ local|ci;
   `SUPER_MERGE_METHOD` ∈ squash|merge|rebase; `SUPER_BRANCH_STYLE` ∈ flat|slashed;
   `SUPER_PANEL_AGENT_TYPE` ∈ general-purpose|Explore;
   `SUPER_REVIEW_CONFIDENCE_FILTER` ∈ controller.
3. **Booleans** (∈ true|false, else WARN + template default): `SUPER_PROTECTED_MAIN`,
   `SUPER_ADMIN_MERGE`, `SUPER_CI_ONE_FLAG_PER_PUSH`, `SUPER_SKIP_FINISHING_HANDOFF`,
   `SUPER_GH_DISABLE_SANDBOX`.
4. **Numerics** (positive integer, else WARN + template default):
   `SUPER_HEAVY_STEP_LIMIT`, `SUPER_LOCK_STEAL_MIN`, `SUPER_CI_RUNNERS`.
   `SUPER_TICK_INTERVAL` must parse as an interval span (e.g. `600`, `90s`, `30m`, `2h`).
5. **Model keys** (each `SUPER_MODEL_*`):
   valid = a Codex model name or `inherit`. A Claude tier name
   (`sonnet|opus|haiku|fable`) or Claude model ID (`^claude-`) → WARN, treat as
   `inherit` (a hand-trimmed `.superenv` can let the claude-flavored plugin default
   leak through).
6. **Effort keys** (each `SUPER_EFFORT_*`):
   valid = `none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|inherit`; else WARN (note: claude's
   `max` is NOT a Codex effort), treat as `inherit`.

## Step 3 — Role agents (model/effort pins)

Nine `SUPER_MODEL_*` role keys dispatch through subagents — all but
`SUPER_MODEL_SUPERVISOR`, which the external tick passes straight to `codex exec -m`.
On Codex there are **no generated agent-definition files at all**: role pins dispatch
at runtime as `spawn_agent` parameters — `SUPER_MODEL_<ROLE>` → `model`,
`SUPER_EFFORT_<ROLE>` → `reasoning_effort`, `inherit` = omit the parameter. This step
therefore **generates nothing**; per the design spec it resolves the effective
model/effort per role and REPORTS them, so a misconfigured pin surfaces here instead
of at spawn time.

Resolve each role's model key (`SUPER_MODEL_<ROLE>`) and effort key (`SUPER_EFFORT_<ROLE>`), using the validated values from the validation step above:

| Model key | Effort key | Generated definition |
|---|---|---|
| SUPER_MODEL_PLANNER | SUPER_EFFORT_PLANNER | `.claude/agents/super-planner.md` |
| SUPER_MODEL_EXECUTOR | SUPER_EFFORT_EXECUTOR | `.claude/agents/super-executor.md` |
| SUPER_MODEL_PANEL | SUPER_EFFORT_PANEL | `.claude/agents/super-panel.md` |
| SUPER_MODEL_IMPLEMENTER | SUPER_EFFORT_IMPLEMENTER | `.claude/agents/super-implementer.md` |
| SUPER_MODEL_FIX_APPLIER | SUPER_EFFORT_FIX_APPLIER | `.claude/agents/super-fix-applier.md` |
| SUPER_MODEL_TASK_REVIEWER | SUPER_EFFORT_TASK_REVIEWER | `.claude/agents/super-task-reviewer.md` |
| SUPER_MODEL_RE_REVIEWER | SUPER_EFFORT_RE_REVIEWER | `.claude/agents/super-re-reviewer.md` |
| SUPER_MODEL_BRANCH_REVIEWER | SUPER_EFFORT_BRANCH_REVIEWER | `.claude/agents/super-branch-reviewer.md` |
| SUPER_MODEL_FIX_PLANNER | SUPER_EFFORT_FIX_PLANNER | `.claude/agents/super-fix-planner.md` |

- **No files are generated or removed on Codex.** The table's "Generated definition"
  column names the Claude Code artifact and is inapplicable in this build. For each
  role, resolve both keys (using the validated values above) and record the effective
  pair in the summary — e.g. `planner: model=gpt-5.1-codex, effort=inherit — n/a
  (spawn-parameter pins)`. At runtime the loop passes these as the `spawn_agent`
  call's `model` / `reasoning_effort` parameters; `inherit` = omit the parameter.
- A leftover `.claude/agents/super-*.md` file from a Claude Code init of the same
  repo belongs to that harness's build: leave it untouched and do not report it as
  stale.

Report per-key results (`generated` /
`regenerated` / `unchanged` / `removed (stale)` / `conflict` / `n/a`) as one summary
row.


## Step 4 — Vault

Resolve `SUPER_GOAL_ROOT` per the resolution order above (shipped default `vault`; a
worked example from the originating repo sets it to `vault/network-compose`). Three cases:

- `<repo-root>/<SUPER_GOAL_ROOT>` does not exist: create it and copy
  `${SUPER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/vault-root.md` to `<SUPER_GOAL_ROOT>/root.md`.
- the directory exists but has no `root.md`: seed `root.md` from the same template.
  Writing a file that is currently absent is not an overwrite, so the intro's
  never-overwrite invariant still holds. `root.md` is not a precondition any skill
  requires — it exists so the goal root has a human-maintained, navigable index of goals
  and lessons from the moment it exists. Leaving it unseeded would silently leave that
  index missing, and because this case only re-checks "does the directory exist," a later
  re-run of init would never heal it — seeding on every run when `root.md` is specifically
  missing is what makes this case actually idempotent-and-self-healing rather than
  idempotent-and-stuck.
- the directory exists and already has a `root.md`: touch nothing.

Report which of the three happened in the summary table — `created` / `seeded root.md
into existing goal root` / `already present` — rather than collapsing the middle case
into either of the other two rows.

## Step 5 — Gitignore

Before appending anything in this step, ensure `<repo-root>/.gitignore` (if it already
exists and is non-empty) ends with a newline — if its last byte is not `\n`, run
`printf '\n' >> .gitignore` first, so an append below never fuses onto the file's last
existing line.

Resolve `SUPER_LOOP_STATUS_DIRNAME` per the resolution order above (shipped default
`loop-status`). Append the line `<SUPER_GOAL_ROOT>/**/<SUPER_LOOP_STATUS_DIRNAME>/` to
`<repo-root>/.gitignore` unless an identical line is already present (create
`.gitignore` if absent). This is the exact pattern `superloop`'s L1 clause documents as
gitignored local-only state (worked example from the originating repo: `vault/**/loop-status/`) — every loop-status
file `superagent`/`superagent-external` write must never be tracked or swept into a
docs-only PR commit.

Also append the line `.env` to `<repo-root>/.gitignore` unless an identical line is
already present (same idempotent check, same newline guard). External (unattended) mode
directs `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`GH_TOKEN` into `<repo>/.env` (see `scripts/README.md`'s
Prerequisites), and that file must never be committed.

## Step 6 — Landing

init only prepares files — it never commits. Tell the user what to commit
(`.superenv`, the vault seed, any generated `.claude/agents/super-*.md` role
definitions, `.gitignore` — now covering both the loop-status pattern
and `.env`) and remind them to follow the repo's own change discipline: if
`SUPER_PROTECTED_MAIN=true` (the shipped default), that means a feature branch + PR, same
as every `superauthor`-driven skill's own A7 commit step. `.env` itself (holding
`OPENAI_API_KEY`/`GH_TOKEN`) stays gitignored and is never committed — only the
`.gitignore` entry that excludes it is.
